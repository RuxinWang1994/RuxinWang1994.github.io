In addition to communication and entertainment, smartphones can also be used as a credit card to make a contactless payment on Kiosk Systems, such as ordering food, printing tickets and self-checkout. When a user holds the phone close to the Kiosk system to present payment credentials, we propose to also verify the user’s identity based on a photo of the back of their smartphone gripping hand, which provides a second security layer. Compared to the widely used facial recognition, the proposed approach addresses the recent struggles of identifying faces under masks and the public concerns of potential privacy erosion, racial bias and misuse. We find that the geometry of each individual's hand, when it grips a phone, is identifiable and then design a vision-based approach to extract the gripping hand biometrics. In particular, we develop hand image processing schemes to detect and localize the gripping hand while denoising and normalizing the hand images (e.g., size and color). Furthermore, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm to distinguish smartphone users' gripping hand images for authentication. Experiments with 20 participants show that the system achieves 99.5% accuracy for user verification.","tags":[],"title":"Low-effort User Authentication for Kiosk Systems based on Smartphone User's Gripping Hand Geometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Ruxin Wang__","Long Huang","and Chen Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639453099,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639453099,"objectID":"a3f30e11f86dfdbf13b3f1991292ff8b","permalink":"https://RuxinWang1994.github.io/publication/mass21/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T21:38:19-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mass21/","section":"publication","summary":"Handheld phone distraction is the leading cause of traffic accidents. However, few efforts have been devoted to detecting when the phone distraction happens, which is a critical input for taking immediate safety measures. This work proposes a phone-use monitoring system, which detects the start of the driver’s handheld phone use and eliminates the distraction at once. Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if the phone is being held in hand or placed on support surfaces (e.g., seat and cup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the contact object’s damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time Fourier transform from the microphone data to describe such impacts and develop a CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the handheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design an adaptive window-based filter to correct the classification errors and identify each handheld phone distraction instance, including its start, end, and duration. Extensive experiments with fourteen people, three phones and two car models show that our system achieves 99% accuracy of recognizing handheld phone-use instances and 0.76-second median error to estimate the distraction’s start time.","tags":[],"title":"Preventing Handheld Phone Distraction for Drivers by Sensing the Gripping Hand","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Ruxin Wang__","Long Huang","and Chen Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635387976,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635387976,"objectID":"6e1caa48d5033fdcb26e1b31df6f12c7","permalink":"https://RuxinWang1994.github.io/publication/mobicom21/","publishdate":"2021-10-27T22:15:16-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mobicom21/","section":"publication","summary":"Phone usage while driving is unanimously considered a really dangerous habit due to a strong correlation with road accidents.
